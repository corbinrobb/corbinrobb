# Hello! I'm Corbin! ðŸ‘‹ (He/Him)

I am a Full-Stack Developer that was trained by Bloom Institute of Technology (formerly Lambda School).  
\
I am always excited to learn new things and I am a huge fan of self teaching, especially through experience. Go fast and break things or go slow and be careful,
both are fine by me as long as I get to keep moving and learning. Building projects as a developer is a dream come true. I get to work with smart and talented people while using my brain to come up with elegant solutions to complex problems.

\
I am currently working on some projects on my own to practice new technologies and further improve my skills. I am also making contributions to open source projects when I find the time.

\
If you need any help on interesting open source projects or have any positions that you are trying to fill, feel free to reach out to me through my contacts below!
