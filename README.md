# Hello! I'm Corbin! ðŸ‘‹

*(He/Him)*

Full-Stack Developer trained by Bloom Institute of Technology (formerly Lambda School) that enjoys working on open source projects and learning new things.  
\
I am always excited to learn something new and I am a huge fan of self teaching, especially through experience. Building projects as a developer is a dream come true because I get to work with smart and talented people while using my brain to come up with elegant solutions to complex problems.

\
Being active is one of my favourite things so you will often find me doing boxing training and weight lifting at the gym or taking a leisurely stroll through a park. I occasionally play the guitar and draw things, even though I am not good at either, I still find them enjoyable and relaxing! I have recently begun learning Japanese in preparation to visit family in Japan and I am loving the language and the learning process.

\
Currently I am working on some projects on my own to practice new technologies and further improve my skills, as well as making contributions to open source projects.


\
I am open to new opportunities! If you need any help on interesting open source projects or have any positions that you are trying to fill, please feel free to reach out!
